# contact-form-php
working contact form with server side validation - made with PHP

project in progress

CSS style will be added next. Once that is done I will add a guide on how to use the program in your own website in the README.

## Description
This project is a working contact form that can be inserted into any website that uses php. It contains the fields "name" "email" "subject" and "message".

The form will be able to be customized. The minimum customization that needs to be done is adding the email address at which the website owner wants to receive messages at.

## Background
I made this contact form as an exercise to practice Object Oriented Programming. I was trying to rewrite the concepts that I used in the contact form for [Christian's website](https://github.com/lujoh/Website-Christian-Hackbarth-Johnson/blob/main/Kontaktform.php)
using Object Oriented methods

## Technologies Used
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS (to do)
